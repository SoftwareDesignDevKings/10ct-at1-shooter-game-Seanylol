Note: cleanedgamel.py is the final version of the game class incorporating spikes and particles as proper objects.

Gameplay controls:
Press B to shoot
Press T and the mouse click at desired location to teleport
Press C for spread shot
Note that the power ups will run out so you should pay attention to the counter
WASD for movement(changed from arrow keys)
Powerup icons:
The white circle is for spread shot
The blue T is for teleport
The white B is for beam(did not size properly)



Bugs:
-In the lower levels player speed is 6 times faster than the enemy, so any direct collision will result in continuous damage taken due to insufficient knockback.
This problem doesn't exist anymore when levels progress and player speed reduces.
I will try to implement relevant changes before final submission.
